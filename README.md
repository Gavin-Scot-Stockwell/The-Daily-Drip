# The Daily Drip

The Daily Drip is a personal hydration diary designed to help you stay on top of your water intake. You can jot down any notes about how hydration is affecting your body and log your water consumption. Whether youâ€™re aiming for better health, clearer skin, or just more energy, The Daily Drip makes it easy to keep track of your efforts. At the end of each day, you will get a clear picture of your hydration habits with a daily average, helping you see your progress and make improvements. Stay hydrated, stay healthy, and let The Daily Drip assist you in your growth. 

## Usage

TRACK YOUR PROGRESS

After you have completed your diary, the overall average will update so that you can keep track of your hydration progress with every recorded entry.
